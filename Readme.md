**Curio Demo Repository**

This repository contains demo python programs based on the tutorial 
at from https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html.  The 
tutorial located there walks one through the various features of the
curio library.  

This repository contains a separate program for each
step in the tutorial.  The pdf file Curio Presentation.pdf guides one
through the steps leading to the changes from one program to the 
next.

The bin directory contains a shell script for monitoring the curio
tasks.

These programs have been tested with Python 3.6.  The only external
library required is curio itself.
